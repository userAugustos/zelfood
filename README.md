# zelfood
Zelfood it's a website that records foods, ok sounds weirdo. 

### This is a chalenge proposed by Andrew of Zelpay

## So you need to rum npm instal ou yarn in api and zelfood, in both folders.

 - After this, to run Api and read/write in json, run **npm run dev**
 - And **npm start** to start the reactjs
 -After this, just test :)
